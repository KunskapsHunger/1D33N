Looking for clarity in an ever growing void
Searching for sanity before the world recoils
The air is filled with its essence
The shadows illuminate its presence
I never truly stopped to look
The abyss, still has hooks
The light was never for me to find
-- The brutal truth is that I don't mind




Hello darkness, my old friend.
I've come to embrace you once again
