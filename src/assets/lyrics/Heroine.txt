She fought the wolves in the forest night
All alone - forced to fight
Her back against the stone wall
Chin up, she was born tall
No giving up is the core call
Fangs treating her like a torn ball
Scarred tissue - the final page of the issue
On the floor the magazine lies
Our hero got heroine ties
Lying on with needles in her skin
She's fighting wolves from within

Sorrow in the midnight call
The heroine brightens all
Joy finds the place of no escape
Short lived flame in the fireplace

Her kids watching her fall
Grasping hands with no reach at all
Forced to grow where no one sows
Forced to tow the ungrown spoils
Dissociation, her destination
Resting with ziggy on a space station
No energy for rumination
Running to reach escape velocity
Running away from her own atrocity
The dust settles down on us
We keep yearning, but there's no learning
in a heroine's journey 

Sorrow in the midnight call
The heroine brightens all
Joy finds the place of no escape
Short lived flame in the fireplace
